# Tuesday, 7 July 2020   Implementing Zettlekasten

There's lots of similarities between [[zettelkasten]] & [[GTD]]. 

Basic [[zettlekasten]] methodology:
- capture
  - reading
  - taking down notes
- elaborate (turn notes into Zettels)
- connect (always link from an existing Zettel)

recommendation is to use unique identifiers so that if titles change, they are still linked correctly, don't think this is currently possible in Foam, however it was in Roam.
