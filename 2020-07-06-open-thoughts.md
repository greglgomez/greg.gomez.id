# Monday, 6 July 2020   Open Thoughts

Finally, a home for me on the web that makes sense. 
- writing is as easy as it gets with markdown.
- thoughts are trivially linked for additional insight.
- publishing requires minimal tooling with [Foam](foambubble.github.io/) & Github Pages.

I can finally effortlessly build my own [digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) and share my thoughts and inner workings in a way that works just as well whilst I work, as it does when I want to publish.

I've made a start with some key pages such as [[projects]], [[areas]], [[cv]], & [[life-goals]]. Now to port over all my stuff from Roam Research, Ulysses & Pocket. ðŸ˜¬

GG, over and out.
