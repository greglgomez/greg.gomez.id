ðŸ‘‹ hey there, welcome my digital garden! 

I'm Greg Gomez, a digital project manager who for the past few years has been diving into the world of [[permaculture]].

## my story
with 8 years experience with digital project management, I've grown dissatisfied with the tech industry: it's effects on the planet, it's effect on society and the way value is amassed in the hands of the few. I've been on a journey to find a better way to live my life and earn a living that doesn't sacrifice my personal ethics.

Here are some starting points for exploring my digital garden:

- [[projects]] for things I'm working on.
- [[cv]] for things I've worked on.
- [[areas]] for overarching interests in my life.
- [[thoughts]] for my ramblings.
